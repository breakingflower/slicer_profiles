## Printing Profiles

I use the same settings on both my CR10 and CR10s. 

## Naming convention

Filaments: 

< Brand > < Filament Type > < Color >

Print Profiles: 

< Layer Height > < Keyword >

Keyword is e.g. 'Draft' or 'Quality'. This is always with respect to the selected printer definition and therefore dependent on the nozzle size.
